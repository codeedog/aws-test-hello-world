This file could be hand created. However, I copied it from the last time
the system created a cache file for the original function that included
the node_modules. Point being, the package.json file could originate from
numerous sources:
 1. By hand
 2. Automatically, from an esbuild within cdk synth/deploy
 3. Automatically, from a docker build within cdk synth/deploy
 4. Automatically, from a webpack build (modified nx/monorepo style)

***VERY IMPORTANT***

File must be in a directory structure matching the final structure expected
for layer deployment. Specifically, **/nodejs/node_modules/**. CDK code that
gobbles up this directory does not automatically place node_modules into the
correct structure.
